## HWSensors 
- Fork of [kozlekek](https://github.com/kozlekek/HWSensors)

#### HWSensors is a software bundle that includes drivers and applications that allow you to access information from hardware sensors available on your Mac.

#### FakeSMC is an open source SMC device driver/emulator developed by netkas.

#### NOTE: FakeSMC & Plugins starting from v915 provide additional sensors information to HWMonitor on Macs. By installing FakeSMC on a real Mac you acknowledge that you know what you are doing and how to recover your system if something goes wrong.



### I have it changed a bit for the Dark Mode of macOS Mojave

### Anyone who would like to help make the project even better for macOS Mojave is welcome, just ask me
